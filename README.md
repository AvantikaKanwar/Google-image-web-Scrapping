I built a Google image scraping project using Python and Flask, where the backend script automated image collection using selenium and requests, extracting URLs based on 
user-defined keywords. I integrated Flask to create a simple web interface that allowed users to input search terms, trigger the scraping process, and view download status in 
real time. The project handled broken links and duplicates, storing images locally for dataset creation or visual analysis.
